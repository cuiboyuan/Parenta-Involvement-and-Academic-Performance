# Whether Maternal and Paternal Involvement Have Different Effects on Student’s Academic Performance

## Abstract

This report conducts a propensity score matching (PSM) analysis to explore whether mother’s involvement
and father’s involvement have different effects on the student’s academic performance. It makes use of an
observational dataset offered by the University of Jordan. Two models are constructed in this paper: a
logistic model that estimates the propensity score with gender, grade, and place of birth as the baseline
characteristics and a linear model that takes both the student’s engagement and parent’s involvements into
account to assess the total marks of the student. Together with these models and the PSM technique, the paper has discovered that the mother's involvement is more likely to help students obtain better academic achievements than the father's involvement, with a p-value of 0.0000828
